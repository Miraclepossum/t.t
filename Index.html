<h1>Roxanna Villamizar</h1>
<p> Hey, my full name might be too long cause Latino names usually are, but yes, I know that song from <a class="one" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T1c7GkzRQQ">The Police</a>. I have a bachelor's in Film and Media and a postgraduate in professional writing. While doing my bachelor's, I took some web development classes and found them interesting, even if they scared me. I like long walks, the smell of coffee and overly complicated colour names like periwinkle; I think that pigeons are the daily evidence of what happens to a living being when it is deemed unproductive, and I love the concept of soup for breakfast; I love learning new stuff and hope you have a great day.
