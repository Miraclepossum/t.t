<p> Hey, my full name might be too long cause Latino names usually are, but yes, I know that song from <a class="one" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T1c7GkzRQQ">The Police</a>. I have a bachelor's in Film and Media and a postgraduate in professional writing. While doing my bachelor's, I took some web development classes and found them interesting, even if they scared me. I like long walks, the smell of coffee and overly complicated colour names like periwinkle; I think that pigeons are the daily evidence of what happens to a living being when it is deemed unproductive, and I love the concept of soup for breakfast; I love learning new stuff and hope you have a great day.
</p>  I included the link to the song incase someone doesn't know what song im talking about

<p>IT is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

    However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
    
    ``My dear Mr. Bennet,'' said his lady to him one day, ``have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?''
    
    Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
    
    ``But it is,'' returned she; ``for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.''
    
    Mr. Bennet made no answer.
    
    ``Do not you want to know who has taken it?'' cried his wife impatiently.
    
    ``You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.''
    
    This was invitation enough.</p>
